# E-mail Marketing Framework plugin for Apsis integration

Apsis is a hosted email newsletter manager. The Apsis EMF module extends the E-mail Marketing Framework module to provide user account synchronization with Drupal and simple sign-up/list subscription management for users.

This module requires the E-mail Marketing Framework and an account at Apsis.

See the install.txt for more information.

This is an early beta, the dependency to the nusoap library will be removed in the near future.

If you want to change the subscription blocks template, then copy the 'example-block-emf-common.tpl.php' to your theme dir and rename to either block-emf.tpl.php or block-emf-common.tpl.php
